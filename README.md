Restaurant Menu System
Description
The Restaurant Menu System provides a structured way to manage and display a restaurant's menu items. The system can handle composite menu structures, including individual menu items and submenus, allowing for hierarchical menu representations. It demonstrates the Composite design pattern to effectively manage complex menus.

Key Features
Composite Pattern: Manages and displays menus and submenus hierarchically.

Smart Home System
Description
The Smart Home System simulates a centralized control hub that allows users to manage various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks. Users can turn devices on or off, set schedules for automatic operations, and automate tasks based on specific triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature). The system leverages key design patterns to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable code.

Key Features
Observer Pattern: Notifies all devices of changes in the system.
Factory Method Pattern: Creates instances of different smart devices.
Proxy Pattern: Controls access to devices.
Strong OOP Principles: Ensures encapsulation, modularity, and use of inheritance and polymorphism.
